Navigation drawers let people switch between UI views on larger devices

Note:

The navigation drawer is no longer recommended in the Material 3 Expressive update. For those who have updated, use an [expanded navigation rail](../../m3/pages/navigation-rail/overview), which has mostly the same functionality of the navigation drawer and adapts better across window size classes.

- Use standard navigation drawers in 

  expanded, 

  large, and 

  extra-large window sizes
- Use modal navigation drawers in 

  compact and 

  medium window sizes
- Can be open or closed by default
- Two variants: standard and modal
- Put the most frequent destinations at the top and group related destinations together

1. Standard navigation drawer
2. Modal navigation drawer
