# Button groups

Source: https://m3.material.io/components/button-groups/accessibility

Button groups organize buttons and add interactions between them

## Use cases

People should be able to do the following with assistive technology:

- Navigate to and interact with each button in the group
- Identify when buttons are selected

## Interaction & 

Each button in a group should have a minimum 48x48dp target.   
  
Extra small and small button groups have larger inner padding to ensure accessible targets. Avoid reducing the padding in these sizes.

1. Extra small button group
2. Small button group

### Initial focus

The button group container is not a focusable element. Initial focus should land on the first button in the group and then move to each button.

Initial focus should land on the first button, not on the container

Use **Tab** to navigate through each item in the group, and **Space** or **Enter** to select buttons.

## Labeling elements

The button group container does not need to be labeled. Label each button according to the button and icon button accessibility guidance.

![In a messaging products, an email icon is labelled “email” with the role “button”.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fm0dh20ef-label.png?alt=media&token=a99c4ff1-098a-4c02-91fc-b8510e558d48)

Label each button within the button group
