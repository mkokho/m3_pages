# Switch

Source: https://m3.material.io/components/switch/overview

Switches toggle the selection of an item on or off

- Use switches (not 

  radio buttons) if the items in a 

  list can be independently controlled
- Switches are the best way to let people adjust settings
- Make sure the switch’s 

  selection (on or off) is visible at a glance

Switches can be toggled on and off

  dynamic color
