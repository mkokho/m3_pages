## Use cases

People should be able to do the following using the assistive technology:

- Navigate to the progress indicator
- Understand what progress the indicator is communicating

## Interaction & 

The active indicator, which displays progress, provides visual contrast of at least 3:1 against most background colors.

The progress indicator and stop indicator provide visual contrast of at least 3:1 against most background colors

When integrated into another component, such as a button, make sure that the active indicator provides visual contrast of at least 3:1 against the other component.

For the active indicator, use the same color as the label text or icon. The track should be removed.

**Do:** 

Ensure the indicator’s color provides at least 3:1 contrast against the surface it's on

**Don't:** 

Avoid using a color below 3:1 contrast

For linear progress indicators, the stop indicator is required if the track has a contrast below 3:1 with its container or the surface behind the container.

Essentially, the end of the track must be easy to identify.

**Do:** 

Only remove the stop indicator when the linear progress indicator has at least a 3:1 color contrast with surrounding containers and surfaces

![Bright container holding progress indicator is on a bright surface, failing the 3:1 color contrast.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fmlepe18t-05.png?alt=media&token=58f9d951-ddc2-47c4-9ab8-3707bfac503d)

**Don't:** 

Avoid removing the stop indicator if any adjacent containers or surfaces are below the 3:1 color contrast

## Labeling elements

Since the progress indicator is a visual cue, it needs an accessibility label to describe the kind and amount of progress made.

Use the **progress bar**accessibility role, and write an accessibility label that describes the purpose of the progress indicator. The label should include the process, such as "loading,” and the affected content, such as a page, article, or episode. For example: "Loading news article" or "Refreshing page."

![Determinate linear progress indicator has an accessibility label of “loading news article” and role of “progressbar”.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fmlepereg-06.png?alt=media&token=71630831-8fa7-41a6-acb2-ae63c344ab9f)

Progress indicator labels should explain which items are loading

![Indeterminate linear progress indicator has an accessibility label of “loading my episodes” and role of “progressbar.”](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fmlepf1vr-07.png?alt=media&token=31415e5b-41fb-4ebe-a455-8ebbc9f47abd)
