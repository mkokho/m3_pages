## M3 Expressive update

**May 2025**

The extended FAB now has three sizes: small, medium, and large, each with updated type styles. These align with the 

FAB sizes for an easier transition between FABs. The baseline extended FAB is no longer recommended and should be replaced with the small extended FAB. Surface and FABs are also no longer recommended. [More on M3 Expressive](https://m3.material.io/blog/building-with-m3-expressive)

Variants and naming:

- Added new sizes

  - Small: 56dp
  - Medium: 80dp
  - Large: 96dp
- No longer recommended

  - Baseline extended FAB (56dp)
  - Surface extended FAB

Updates:

- Adjusted typography to be larger

The baseline extended FAB is replaced with a set of small, medium, and large extended FABs with new typography

## Differences from M2

- Color: New color mappings and compatibility with dynamic color
- Layout: Extended FAB is the same height as the FAB
- Shape: Boxier  with smaller corner radius
