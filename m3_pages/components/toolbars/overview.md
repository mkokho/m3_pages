## M3 Expressive update

The **bottom app bar** is no longer recommended and should be replaced with the **docked toolbar**, which functions similarly, but is shorter and has more flexibility. The **floating toolbar** was created for more versatility, greater amounts of actions, and more variety in where it's placed. [More on GM3 Expressive](https://m3.material.io/blog/building-with-m3-expressive)

Variants and naming:

- Added **docked toolbar**to replace **bottom app bar**

  - Size: Shorter height
  - Color: Standard or vibrant
  - Flexibility: More layout and element options
- Added **floating toolbar** with the following configurations:

  - Layout: Horizontal or vertical
  - Color: Standard or vibrant
  - Flexibility: Can hold many elements and components. Can be paired with FAB.
- **Bottom app bar**is still available, but not recommended

1. Floating, vibrant color scheme and paired with FAB
2. Docked with embedded primary action instead of FAB

## Differences from M2

- Color: New color mappings and compatibility with dynamic color
- Elevation: No shadow
- Layout: Container height is taller and the FAB is now contained within the app bar container
