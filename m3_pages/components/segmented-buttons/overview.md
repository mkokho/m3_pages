Segmented buttons help people select options, switch views, or sort elements

star

Note:

Segmented buttons are no longer recommended in the Material 3 expressive update. For those who have updated, use the [connected button group](../../m3/pages/button-groups/overview) instead, which has mostly the same functionality but with an updated visual design.

- Segmented buttons can contain icons, label text, or both
- Two variants: single-select and multi-select
- Use for simple choices between two to five items (for more items or complex choices, use 

  chips)
