# Navigation rail

Source: https://m3.material.io/components/navigation-rail/overview

Navigation rails let people switch between UI views on mid-sized devices

- Use navigation rails in medium, expanded, large, or extra-large window sizes
- Can contain 3-7 destinations plus an optional FAB
- Always put the rail in the same place, even on different screens of an app

Collapsed and expanded navigation rails can transition between each other on any device, including: 

1. Large or medium window size classes like tablets  
2. Compact window size classes like phones in portrait orientation

## M3 Expressive update

**May 2025**

A **collapsed** and **expanded** navigation rail have been introduced to replace the baseline nav rail. The expanded nav rail is meant to replace the

Variants and naming:

- Added two wider navigation rails:

  - **Collapsed:** replaces baseline nav rail
  - **Expanded**: replaces 

    navigation drawer

Configurations:

The collapsed and expanded navigation rails match visually and can transition into each other

## Differences from M2

- Behavior: Predictive back interaction
- Color: New color mappings and compatibility with dynamic color
- States: The active destination can be indicated with a pill shape in a contrasting color

M2: The navigation rail uses icon color, weight, and fill to communicate which destination is active
