The motion physics system makes a UI expressive and easy to use

## Cross-platform experiences

The motion physics system is available on Jetpack Compose and MDC-Android, and can be easily adapted to other platforms.

| Platform | Status | How to apply |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jetpack Compose | Available | Use built-in components and spring tokens. |
| MDC-Android | Available. Not yet added to components. | Use built-in spring tokens. |
| Web | Compatible | Use springs when possible, otherwise use curves that mimic the springs for animations without interruptions or gestures. [View web conversion table](../../../components/tabs/specs.md#e3e4f10b-6314-47b7-9051-988066081fa0) |

## Tokens and specs

The **spring composite**tokens are used in the motion physics system. These composites combine two **spring** tokens (damping and stiffness) into a single token for ease of use. The **easing**, **duration**, and **path** tokens are used by the legacy system, so can be ignored.

## Easing and duration

The original easing and duration tokens are still available to use as a fallback, and are currently used for animating transitions. [View easing and duration system](https://m3.material.io/styles/motion/easing-and-duration/applying-easing-and-duration)
