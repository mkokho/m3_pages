## M3 Expressive update

**May 2025**

### Updated M3 type scale with emphasized styles

Material’s type scale includes fifteen **baseline** type styles, the same as before, and fifteen new **emphasized** type styles.

The emphasized type styles add more expression to highlighted moments.

Roboto Flex can be used on its own to show a range of emotional states, but is not yet part of the M3 typescale.

The expressive type scale includes fifteen baseline type styles and fifteen emphasized type styles

### Emphasized type  tokens

Design tokens offer an improved way to define typography in products by assigning an element's type  by a configurable value, rather than a set value.

Emphasized tokens allow for clearer hierarchies and prioritized components within a layout.

Type roles describe size—such as small, medium, and large—enabling them to adapt and respond to the device or context.

Typography tokens describe scalable size that adapts to devices or settings, including updating the  on boldness

## Previous updates

### Variable fonts

**Roboto Flex, Roboto Serif, & Roboto Mono**

Updated considerations for using variable fonts and different combinations of their customizable axes, including grade, width, weight, slant, and optical size.

Roboto Flex, Roboto Serif, and Roboto Mono have a fluid range of axes, like weight, across all optical sizes

### Style roles

Type styles are defined by five roles: display, headline, title, body, and label.

These names are more descriptive, allowing for easier matching of type  to use case.
