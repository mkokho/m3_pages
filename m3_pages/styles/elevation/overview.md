# Elevation

Source: https://m3.material.io/styles/elevation/overview

Elevation is the distance between two surfaces on the z-axis

- Elevation is applied to all surfaces and components
- Tokens codify the distance on the z-axis to ensure components appear consistently relative to each other
- Tokens have no shadows or color; each platform determines the specific shadows and values to use at each elevation level
- Elevation can be shown as tonal surface colors or shadows
- Avoid changing the default elevation of Material 3 components
- Stick to using a small amount of elevation levels

Elevation is measured as the distance between components along the z-axis in density-independent pixels (dps).

A second one shows a side view of the squares in elevation, showing that the light square is lower in elevation than the dark square.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Flwykafum-1.png?alt=media&token=686eda7a-aed0-4d34-a749-0b01f2a50a86)

Elevation represents the distance between elements. The product applies color to represent elevation.

2. The difference in elevation between the two surfaces is 7dp, as viewed from the side

## Differences from M2

- Shadows: Instead of applying shadows by default to all levels, use shadows only when required to create additional protection against a background or to encourage interaction
- Color: New color mappings and compatibility with dynamic color
- Levels: Elevation is now described in terms of levels

M2: Shadows applied at all levels

![Diagram of 2 concentric squares without shadows. Instead, the inner square is at level and tonally darker than the outer square, which is at level 2.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Flwykckey-3.png?alt=media&token=fd1c5548-7048-4d2c-9123-17308e339731)

M3: Using color instead of shadows to communicate elevation

## All surfaces and components have elevation values

Surfaces at different elevations do the following:

1. Allow surfaces to move in front of and behind other surfaces, such as content scrolling behind app bars
2. Reflect spatial relationships, such as how a FAB's shadow indicates it's separate from a card collection
3. Focus attention on the highest elevation, such as a dialog temporarily appearing in front of other surfaces

Elevation can be depicted using shadows or other visual cues, such as surface fills with a tone difference

### Resting elevation (default)

All components have a default resting elevation. Avoid changing the default elevation of Material components.

All components have a default elevation which should be used

### Changing elevation

Components should change elevation in response to system events or user interaction, like hovering. This elevation change should be consistent across all similar elements.

For example, hovering a FAB temporarily increases the elevation by 1 level, from level 3 to level 4. All Material buttons increase elevation by 1 level when hovered.

Hovering over a button increases its elevation to show user interaction
