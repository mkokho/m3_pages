# Accessibility designing

Implement intuitive, accessible layouts, considering structure, color, and flow

Designing and implementing accessible product experiences involve a range of considerations. The framework Material uses draws on WCAG standards and industry best practices.

The three stages described in these tabs help **translate a visual UI into a text-based, linear user experience that maps to code**. Color and contrast also support accessible navigation.

### Accessibility markup

Accessibility markup is an integral part of creating documentation for design specs.

### Implementing accessibility

By using standard platform controls and semantic HTML (on the web), apps automatically contain the markup and code needed to work well with a platform’s assistive technology. Meeting each platform's accessibility standards and supporting its assistive technology (including shortcuts and structure) gives users an efficient experience.

**Do:** 

Use native elements, such as the standard platform dialog

**Don't:** Be wary of using non-standard elements, such as a non-standard platform dialog to perform a standard dialog task. It requires extra testing to work well with assistive technology.
