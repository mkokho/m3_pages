# Selection

Source: https://m3.material.io/foundations/interaction/selection

Selection is how people interact with UI elements or choose which items to act on

- Selection is shown through changes to surface color or other visible elements
- An entire component can be selected, or just certain parts in a component
- Selection can be performed via tap, cursor, keyboard, or voice

## Types of selection

### Touch

On touch devices, select items using:

- Long press touch or two-finger touch
- Selection shortcut, if available, such as tapping an avatar

Items in a list selected via touch

### Entering and exiting selection mode

To select an item and enter selection mode, long press the item or use a shortcut, such as tapping the item’s avatar. To select additional items, tap each of them.

To exit a selection mode, tap each selected item until they’re unselected, or tap an action on the toolbar.

Entering and exiting selection mode

### Larger selections

To select multiple items simultaneously, long press and drag across items. Don’t use this gesture combination if it is already in use to pick up and move items, like cards.

**Do:** 

**Long press** and **drag** can be used together to select items in batches

**Don't:** 

If the **long press** and **drag** combination is already in use to pick up and move components, like cards, then the combined gesture can’t also be used for selecting items in batches

### Click

On desktop, checkboxes are always visible when selection is the primary activity. When selection is secondary, checkboxes (or other indicators) are displayed:

- As a single checkbox for that item on hover
- For all items after one item is selected

To make a selection, hover over an item to reveal a checkbox. The checkbox can then be clicked.

Checkboxes are visible by default in this table because selection is a primary activity
