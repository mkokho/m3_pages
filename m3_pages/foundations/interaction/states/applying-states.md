# States

States show the interaction status of a component or UI element

## Enabled

An enabled state communicates an interactive component or element. Enabled states use the default styling for each interactive component.

![Enabled state of 4 components.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fly2qpw4a-1.png?alt=media&token=0bec13e6-8bd8-4dc3-9439-6e9d9ff68b4e)

Enabled states for:

1. Button
2. FAB
3. Switch
4. Text field

## Disabled

A disabled state communicates when a component or element isn’t interactive. This state is visually communicated through color changes and reduced elevation.

**Disabled states don't need to meet Material's contrast requirements.**

Disabled button

Disabled states **are** inherited by action, selection, and input components:

- Buttons
- Cards
- Checkboxes
- Chips
- List items
- Radio buttons
- Switches
- Text fields

![Inoperable state of 4 components.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fly2qtg0r-3.png?alt=media&token=469e37f6-f896-42c0-8d8a-2024ad74a6ee)

Disabled states for:

1. Checkbox
2. Icon button
3. Radio button
4. Segmented button

Disabled states **aren't** inherited by communication, containment, navigation, and some actions components: 

- App bars
- Badges
- Dialogs
- Floating action buttons (FABs)
- Menus
- Navigation bar, drawer, and rail
- Sheets
- Tabs
- Tooltips

![Screen erroneously showing edit FAB in inoperable state, though the edit function is unavailable.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fly2quyuj-4.png?alt=media&token=3366711f-aafa-4b7e-ab99-1a0f6c67378e)

**Don't:** 

If the action represented in the FAB is unavailable, the FAB shouldn't appear

### Behavior

Disabled components can’t be focused, dragged, or pressed, and they don’t change state when tapped or hovered over.

A disabled button doesn’t inherit hover or other state layers

There can be any number of disabled states in a layout.

![Disabled components on a screen.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Flyml0ix7-6.png?alt=media&token=c6c1365d-7e53-471d-a1e4-8babbf37b298)

1. Disabled redo icon button
2. Disabled checklist icon button

## Hover

Hover states are initiated by the user pausing over an interactive element using a cursor.

The lower-emphasis surface overlay for hover states can be applied to the entire component, elements within a component, or as a circular shape over part of the component.

![Cursor moves toward button which reads “enabled” and when the cursor touches the button text changes to “hovered.”](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fly2vwc74-7.png?alt=media&token=728c0b8a-43b5-49a2-8640-a0c368d2e966)

![Mobile screen with the whole  app bar wrongly in hover state.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fly2vymng-9.png?alt=media&token=5cf648b1-7239-43fd-a65f-9198fd11f289)

**Don't:** 

The individual components that are actionable within the app bar inherit hover states, not the whole app bar

### Behavior

Hover states are initiated by the user pausing over an interactive element using a cursor.

Hover states appear and disappear using a low-emphasis animated fade

Hover states can be combined with focused, activated, selected, or pressed states.

There can only be one hover state at a time in a layout.

Hover state can only be on one element at a time based on cursor position

## Focused

A focused state communicates when a user has highlighted an element using a keyboard or voice. Focus states apply to all interactive components.

The higher-emphasis surface overlay for focused states can be applied to the entire component, elements within a component, or as a circular shape over part of the component.

**Don't:** 

The individual components that are actionable within the app bar inherit focus states, not the whole app bar

### Keyboard focus indicator

Many people use the **Tab** key or other shortcut to navigate the interactive elements of a web page, like links, buttons, and chips.

When an element is tabbed to, it appears in its focused state with a ring-like **keyboard focus indicator**. This indicator helps web users know where they are on the page.

While focused, an element can be acted on with the keyboard.

![A single filled button in focused state, displaying the keyboard focus indicator.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fly2wdmfh-16.png?alt=media&token=68221847-c082-4963-8058-4e75a9c38465)

### Behavior

Focus states are initiated by the user by pressing the **Tab** key on the keyboard (or equivalent).

Focus states can be represented in combination with hover, activated, or selected states.

## Pressed

A pressed state communicates a user-initiated tap or click via cursor, keyboard, or voice input. This state applies to all interactive components.

Pressed states trigger a change in composition and should be high-emphasis.

A ripple overlay signifies a pressed state. It can be applied to an entire component or elements within a component, or as a circular shape over part of the component.

![Button using a ripple overlay to signify it’s in a pressed state.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fly2wj03t-25.png?alt=media&token=776a2614-2e05-4545-96d3-a6bc53947375)

Some components, such as buttons or cards, can inherit elevation to signify a pressed state.

## Dragged

A dragged state occurs when a user presses and moves an element or component. Dragged states should be low emphasis, to avoid distracting users from their task.

Dragged states use a lower emphasis overlay. It can be applied to the entire component or to elements within a component.

Some components, such as list items, chips, or cards, can inherit elevation to signify a dragged state.

![List item shown in dragged state.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fly2wu37e-32.png?alt=media&token=fefabf35-2cb5-4fdd-b0bb-4cee4442d148)

### Behavior

Dragged states are initiated when users touch and hold elements, using an input method such as a tap or click.
