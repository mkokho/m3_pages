# Canonical layouts

Source: https://m3.material.io/foundations/layout/canonical-layouts/supporting-pane

Canonical layouts are designs for common screen layouts across all window size classes

The supporting pane layout organizes content into primary and secondary areas.   
  
The primary area occupies the majority of the body area and contains the main content. The secondary area contains supporting content.  
  
Key use cases for supporting pane layouts include:

- Productivity
- Document editing and commenting
- Content and media browsing

## Usage

Use the supporting pane layout when the secondary content is only meaningful in relation to the primary content.   
  
For content with a parent-child relationship, use a list-detail view layout instead.

## Dividing space

The screen is divided between a focus pane and a supporting pane.  
  
Depending on the window size class, the supporting pane may appear below or beside the focus pane.

## Across window size classes

### Compact

The supporting pane should appear below the focus pane.   
  
A bottom sheet can be useful for keeping focus on the primary pane while providing access to supporting information.
