# Canonical layouts

Source: https://m3.material.io/foundations/layout/canonical-layouts/feed

Canonical layouts are designs for common screen layouts across all window size classes

A feed layout uses a grid composition to enable quick content browsing and discovery.  
  
Key use cases for the supporting pane layouts include:

- News
- Photos
- Social media

## Usage

Use a feed layout to show different pieces of content through cards and lists.  
  
Feeds support displays of almost any size as grids can adapt from single to multi-column.

![The news feed has 1 column in a compact window class, and 2 columns in the medium window class.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Flxydny00-2.png?alt=media&token=a70edcf6-4a1e-4b88-9a45-f43c34a6bf75)

## Dividing space

A feed composition is flexible enough to allow for content with varying proportions and sizing.

Example feed layout with two columns

Use size and position to establish relationships among content elements.  
  
Feed items should reflow when the amount of available space changes, such as rotating or unfolding a device, or entering a multi-window mode.   
  
The order of items is determined by their position. Learn more about [cards responsive layout guidance](../../../m3/pages/cards/guidelines#99e8d17d-5bde-4bb9-8784-0ca403325b10).

## Across window size classes

### Compact

A feed layout will stack vertically like a list of cards, with individual items taking up the width of the pane, but not necessarily the full height.

### Medium

A feed layout can support components with different widths and be split across multiple columns.

![In a medium window, 2 equal width columns of cards in a feed layout.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Flxydtfa9-6.png?alt=media&token=29871b84-7a76-40e4-8c81-10e33b37f4bb)

### Expanded, large, and extra-large

A feed layout can support components with different widths and be split across multiple columns. The number of columns of content should usually increase for expanded window size classes.

![In an expanded window, 3 equal width columns of cards in a feed layout.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Flxydueo2-7.png?alt=media&token=43a01e2a-1d56-4d9b-870d-61823e01517a)

The number of columns increased from two to three in the expanded window size class

## Behavior

Feed items should reflow when the amount of available space changes, such as rotating or unfolding a device, or entering a multi-window mode. The order of items is determined by their position.
