Window size classes help create layouts that scale across devices of all shapes and sizes

Layouts for medium window size classes are for**screen widths** **from 600dp to 839dp**.

## Navigation

Place navigation components close to edges of the window where they’re easier to reach.

Use a navigation rail or modal navigation drawer for single-pane layouts. Use a navigation bar for two-pane layouts.

The navigation rail can be hidden in secondary destinations as long as the primary destination can still be accessed using a back button.

## Body region

A single pane layout is recommended because of limited screen width. However, a two-pane layout is possible for content with lower information density, such as a settings screen.

1. Single pane layout

Each pane in a two-pane layouts should take up 50% of the window width. Avoid setting custom widths. A drag handle can be used to expand or collapse panes to be 100% of the window width.

![Two-pane layouts in medium windows set both panes to 50% of the window width by default.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fly72o7s8-1p-Diagram%20medium%20double%20pane-2x.png?alt=media&token=bf73c686-a43f-4558-a957-b488ee494ea5)

Two-pane layout

When adding navigation to a two-pane layout, use a navigation bar or a modal navigation drawer. This allows the panes to fully use the available window width.

## Spacing

Medium layouts have margins of 24dp.

The spacer between panes is also 24dp.

Margins and spacer are 24dp

## Special considerations

A medium layout will need to transition dynamically to a compact or expanded layout when:

- A foldable device is folded
- A tablet is rotated from portrait to landscape
- The app goes from full-screen to split-screen
- Multi-window mode is initiated
- A free-form window is resized

### Reachability

For horizontal tablets and unfolded foldables, the top 25% of the screen is likely out of reach, unless the grip is adjusted. To accommodate device and hand sizes, limit the amount of interactions that are placed in the upper 25% of the screen.

Additionally, avoid placing essential interactive elements too close to the bottom edge of the screen. Some users, particularly those with larger hands, might struggle to reach this area.

Limit interactions in the upper quarter of the screen (1). The top 25% of the screen can be hard to reach.

Specify interactions in a layout with these ergonomic regions in mind:

1. Users can reach this area by extending their fingers, which makes it inconvenient
2. Users can reach this area comfortably
3. Reaching this area is challenging when holding the device

Placing critical and frequently used elements close to the screen's bottom edge and corners makes them harder to reach
