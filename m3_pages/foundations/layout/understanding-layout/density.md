# Layout

Source: https://m3.material.io/foundations/layout/understanding-layout/density

Layout is the visual arrangement of elements on the screen

## Overview

- Information density is the consideration of the amount of information visible on the screen
- The default target size should be at least 48x48 CSS pixels
- Users can change density as long as the density controls are accessible
- Apply density thoughtfully; not every layout needs it
- Layout and component scaling (component adaptation or component density) can allow users to scan, view, or compare more information at once

Information density

Component scaling

**Information density**

- Information density can be achieved through layout and design decisions without using component scaling
- Users may not benefit from increased density

**Component scaling**

- Components can adapt and change dimensions to allow users to scan, view, or compare different amounts of information
- Don't apply component scaling by default if it would result in a target below 48x48 CSS pixels

Information density and component scaling can be used together to provide more information and additional user control

## Information density

Information density refers to the amount of content (such as text, images, or videos) in a given screen space.

A layout’s spacing dimensions, including margins, spacers, and padding, can change to increase or decrease its information density. High density layouts can be useful when users need to scan, view, or compare a lot of information, such as in a data table. Increasing the layout density of lists, tables, and long forms makes more content available on-screen.

Consider density settings in the context of a device. Although a user may prefer a denser layout for desktop, they may not for mobile. Density shouldn’t automatically change across window-size classes or device orientation without users changing it.

**Do:** 

Consider using higher density information design when users need to scan lots of information

Consider the amount and priority of information on-screen. Higher density can be useful for data-rich sites (news, financial portals, dashboards) where users expect lots of information quickly.

Lower density can be better for sites prioritizing aesthetics, a focused message, less information, or easier navigation

## Component scaling

The component density scale controls the internal spacing of individual components.

The density scale is numbered, starting at 0 for a component’s default density. The scale moves to negative numbers (-1, -2, -3) as space decreases, creating higher density.

Higher density is typically applied by decreasing the top and bottom padding or overall height by 4dp.

Buttons in 3 different densities. Apply button density based on the needs and layout of a design.

Center the grouped element within the component container.

Text size shouldn’t change as the container size scales.

![Stacked element showing 20 dp between label and input](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Flzje23wv-8.png?alt=media&token=886dc00f-73a5-485e-8bd7-2b6271c65482)

The measurement between the label and input is 20dp

![Parent container showing label above input.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Flzje3e0s-9.png?alt=media&token=13938623-bd72-4399-b745-99f5a4e34c4e)

The label and input are centered within their parent container

**Don't:** 

Don’t increase density in UIs that involve focused tasks, such as selecting from a menu. It reduces usability by limiting selectable space.

**Don't:** 

Don't increase the density in components that alert the user of changes, such as snackbars or dialogs

### Avoid applying component scaling by default

- Don't apply component scaling to layouts by default that lower the target size below a default size of 48x48 CSS pixels
- Allow users to opt for a higher density layout or theme, and provide a simple, accessible way to revert to default best practices

People should be able to **opt****in** to dense layouts and components.

To ensure that density settings can be easily reverted, targets in settings interactions must follow defaults (48x48 CSS pixels).

## Targets

Dense components can be less accessible because interactive elements are smaller, so use caution when increasing information density.

![Selectable target of only 40 dp](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Flzjqo90o-13-caution.png?alt=media&token=6f36346e-923d-4b40-9453-764afeaaf502)

exclamation Caution 

Use caution when applying component scaling where selectable targets will be reduced to less than the 48x48dp best practice and only apply density where it provides a better user experience.

Use caution when applying density to interaction targets. Following best practices, accessible targets should retain a minimum of 48x48dp, even if their visual element (such as an icon) is smaller.

The target should remain 48x48, even if the icon is smaller.

The interaction target of a common button can be larger, as long as it meets the 48x48dp minimum size.

## Pixel density

The number of pixels that fit into an inch is referred to as pixel density. High-density screens have more pixels per inch than low-density ones. As a result, UI elements of the same pixel dimensions appear larger on low-density screens, and smaller on high-density screens.

To calculate pixel density:

Screen density = Screen width (or height) in pixels / Screen width (or height) in inches

### Density-independent pixels

Density-independent pixels, written as dp, are flexible units that scale to have uniform dimensions on any screen. They provide a flexible way to accommodate a design across devices. Material design system uses density-independent pixels to display elements consistently on screens with different densities.

A dp is equal to one physical pixel on a screen with a density of 160.

To calculate dp: dp = (width in pixels \* 160) / screen density
