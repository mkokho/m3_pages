# Layout

Source: https://m3.material.io/foundations/layout/understanding-layout/overview

Layout is the visual arrangement of elements on the screen

- Use layout to direct attention to the action users want to take
- Adapt layouts to 

  compact, 

  medium, 

  expanded, 

  large, and 

  extra-large window size classes
- Build from an established 

  canonical layout
- Consider how spacing and the parts of the layout work together
- Material layout guidance applies to Android and the web

## What’s new

- When creating new layouts, begin from a [canonical layout](../canonical-layouts/overview.md) rather than a layout grid. This helps ensure that your layouts can scale across devices and form factors.
- [Window size classes](../applying-layout/window-size-classes.md) are opinionated breakpoints. Material Design recommends you create layouts for five window size classes: 

  compact, 

  medium, 

  expanded, 

  large, and 

  extra-large
- Layouts with multiple panes of content can be resized with a drag handle

M3 considers multiple layouts for a variety of sizes

## Layout terms

- **Column**: one or more vertical blocks of content within a pane
- **Drag handle:** The component that resizes panes
- **Fold**: on foldable devices, a flexible area of the screen or, on dual-screen devices, a hinge that separates two displays
- **Margin**: the space between the edge of the screen and any elements inside of it
- **Multi-window mode**: enables multiple apps to share the same screen simultaneously
- **Pane**: a layout container that houses other components and elements within a single app. A pane can be: fixed, flexible, floating, or semi permanent
- **Spacer**: the space between two panes
- **Window size class**: opinionated breakpoint, the window size at which a layout needs to change to match available space, device conventions, and ergonomics
